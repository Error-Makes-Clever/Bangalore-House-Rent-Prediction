# Machine Learning Project 1

## üè† Bangalore House Rent Prediction | Machine Learning Project  

This project focuses on predicting house rental prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The data was **collected through web scraping** from real estate platforms, ensuring a diverse and relevant dataset for analysis. The process involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building to accurately estimate rental costs based on factors like size, age, and amenities.  

### üîç Key Highlights  
- **Data Collection:** Automated web scraping from real estate websites.  
- **Data Analysis:** Cleaning and exploring Bangalore house rental data.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming variables to enhance model performance.  
- **Modeling:** Implementing regression models to predict rental prices.  
- **Evaluation:** Analyzing model accuracy and optimizing performance.  

### üöÄ Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup/Selenium for scraping)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
